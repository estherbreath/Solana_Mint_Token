   - Develop an SPL token based on lessons learned or utilize a previously created token.

2. UI Development for Candy Machine:
   - Establish a UI for the Candy Machine using the provided tutorial.
   - Update the start script in package.json to address ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED errors.

3. Token Payment Integration:
